# ble-gspeed dataset
Gait speed estimation using BLE devices

## Dataset

- `mac`: The MAC address of the detected beacon.
- `rssi`: The RSSI value obtained for the beacon. 
- `device`: A four-character descriptor for the smartwatch that performed the scan.
- `timestamp`: The time stamp at which the scan was received.
- `user`: The id of the user that was performing the experiment.
- `direction`: A number (0 or 1) indicating the direction of the walk. 
- `walk_id`: A number that identifies each walk. 
- `speed`: The actual speed of the user, in $m/s$.
